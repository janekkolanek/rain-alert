# rain-alert

This python project will check the weateher for next 12 hours and if it is going to rain it will use twilio.com to send you sms warning about the upcoming weather.

You will need to create account on two sites.
'https://openweathermap.org/'
'https://www.twilio.com/'

Update the project with your information from these sites.

Parameteres in project are set for weateher in Warsaw.

If you want to change it to your city you will need to change lat and lon params in line #15 and #16. You can check for this information on  https://www.latlong.net/

You can host your project on https://www.pythonanywhere.com/ so the project will work everyday.
